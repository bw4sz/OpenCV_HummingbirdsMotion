OpenCV_HummingbirdsMotion
=========================

Technical Aim: Identify which frames in a video have motion and save them to file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use: We have been studying hummingbird plant pollination in North Ecuador. Using innovative camera traps that record images once per second, we have developed a databank of 3.5 tb of flower videos.
On average, 3-5 birds visit the flowers every 6 hours. Instead of manually reviewing the videos, we are designing software using python and open_CV to analyze the videos

If you have ideas about how to do this, i'd love feedback!
Please fork and try it yourself, test files are included in this repository, as well as still frame image ("17") about the desired output
